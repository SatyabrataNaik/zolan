### 1 How to generate concepts
Evidently, we cannot tackle all the problems of a
product by looking at it as a whole. It is important
to understand that we cannot have just one big
idea for all the problems. We have to look at each
problem individually, solve them independently
and finally combine them.  We first generate
as many ideas as possible covering all the possible angles of the problem. These ideas are then grouped to arrive at a
concept. The concept is an amalgamation of several ideas that will cover all the aspects of the product brief. While ideas solve one specific
issue, a concept addresses all the issues related to
the product. Using the checklist, the designers arrive at possible solutions to the problem at hand, in the form of ideas. In finding solutions, designers often draw inspiration from features of existing products and solutions. Different kinds of materials and forms are explored at the stage of conception.

### 2 Design ideas
* Four-wheeled cart for more balanced movement. Unlike 1 or 2 wheeler, user need not lift any part of the cart for movement. Pulling mechanism (little easier than pushing).

</div>

* Less number of parts in 1-wheeler. Can be extended to 2 wheels. Less volume than 4-wheeler. Pusing 
mechanism.
<div markdown="1" >
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/1wheeler.jpg" height="300" width="400">
</div>

* Chains rather than wheels for easy movement on marshy and sandy land. Idea inspired from tanks.

</div>

* Chained grips on wheels for marshy slippery route.

</div>

* Efficient unloading.

</div>

* Efficient loading.

</div>

### 3 Clustering ideas to candidate concepts
##### 3.1 Concept 1
<div markdown="1" >
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/asketch.jpg" height="300" width="400">
</div>
* Integrated loading/collector and container
* Four-wheeled cart, unlike 1 or 2 wheeler, user need not lift any part of the cart for movement
* Only pulling would do the job

##### 3.2 Concept 2
<div markdown="1" >
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/bsketch.jpg" height="300" width="400">
</div>
* Separate loader design, hence no need to carry it every time
* Two-wheeled cart, hence easy mobility
* Fewer parts, easy maintainability


##### 3.3 Concept 3
<div markdown="1" >
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/csketch.jpg" height="300" width="400">
</div>
* Sledge design instead of wheels to help in the marshy environment
* Integrated unloader so has to help easy dropping of the load


### 4 Final concept selection
<div markdown="1" >
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/MasterSketch.jpg" height="600" width="600">
</div>
* Combines all the pro concepts and tries to eliminate the cons from above three concepts
* Detachable loader to ease loading and to maint modular design
* Integrated unloading belt design to help simple rotating mechanism to unload
* Four-wheeled cart to eliminate the need to carry loads

<!-- #### 1.1 Problems and Solutions
The ideas, two to three for each problem, were
thus generated randomly. They were then grouped
as under and analysed: 

###### Problem 1
###### Problem 2
###### Problem 3
###### Problem 4

### 2. The Creation
At this point we had a bank of ideas addressing
various problems. While an idea might solve one
problem, it could be less effective in solving
another problem. Hence, different ideas are combined
to arrive at concepts, which would address all the
issues listed in the product brief.

#### 2.1 Idea Clusters
 The bunching of ideas is done depending on their
affinity towards the common property of the
group. The three idea clusters that emerged were then
assessed for their advantages and disadvantages
as follows:

1. X cluster
2. Y cluster
3. Z cluster

#### 2.2 Clusters to Concepts
1. Concept A
2. Concept B
3. Concept C
