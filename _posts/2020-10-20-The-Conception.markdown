### 1. The Idea
Evidently, we cannot tackle all the problems of a
product by looking at it as a whole. It is important
to understand that we cannot have just one big
idea for all the problems. We have to look at each
problem individually, solve them independently
and finally combine them.  We first generate
as many ideas as possible covering all the possible angles of the problem. These ideas are then grouped to arrive at a
concept. The concept is an amalgamation of several ideas that will cover all the aspects of the product brief. While ideas solve one specific
issue, a concept addresses all the issues related to
the product. 

#### 1.1 Problems and Solutions
The ideas, two to three for each problem, were
thus generated randomly. They were then grouped
as under and analysed: 

###### Problem 1
###### Problem 2
###### Problem 3
###### Problem 4

### 2. The Creation
At this point we had a bank of ideas addressing
various problems. While an idea might solve one
problem, it could be less effective in solving
another problem. Hence, different ideas are combined
to arrive at concepts, which would address all the
issues listed in the product brief.

#### 2.1 Idea Clusters
 The bunching of ideas is done depending on their
affinity towards the common property of the
group. The three idea clusters that emerged were then
assessed for their advantages and disadvantages
as follows:

1. X cluster
2. Y cluster
3. Z cluster

#### 2.2 Clusters to Concepts
1. Concept A
2. Concept B
3. Concept C

#### 2.3 Final Concept Selection
