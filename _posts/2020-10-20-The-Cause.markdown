### The Resolution
The **cause** is not merely a problem or the reason why a design journey was undertaken.  It is a deep need perceived by the designer as something that merits urgent attention. In our case, the cause came out of deep empathy for **hardship for women saltpan workers in carrying/loading/unloading salt**

### Identification of Need
Need for a tool/equipment which can carry loads easily and is capable of self-loading and unloading or effortlessly. Currently used trolleys do not meet these requirements. We need a redesigned trolley.

### Why this Need
1. To eliminate the process of manually carrying baskets of salts over the head/shoulder for transporting from place to place
2. Using baskets usually involves an additional person to lift the basket to keep on head/shoulder. It also involves high physical labour causing joint pains and sill over the body
3. Redesign currently used trolleys to meet the desired features
