### 1 What is connection and why?
Customer satisfaction is the ultimate goal of innovation. Connection is where the primary user provides the feedback. 
The connection between user and product
builds up only when user is satisfied with
product function and performance. Hence, assessing public reaction to the product is vital. 

### 2 Feedback 
Salt pan workers from The Little Rann of Kutch gave us useful feedback. They seem satisfied with the product. Apart from using this trolley for piling salts, it can be used for transporting other materials such as personal belongings or equipment. Our users also said that this trolley will be useful for transporting unnecessary grass and weeds found in salt pans, another use which even we have not thought of.
